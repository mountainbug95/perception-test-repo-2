This time of year feels like a tug of war — on the one hand, the end of the year is jam-packed with desperate requests to get your donations in before the clock strikes midnight on December 31st, and on the other hand, for many of us, charity forms some part of our New Year’s resolutions, whether consciously or subconsciously.

Want to avoid that end-of-the-year rush and make sure that you stick with your resolution and incorporate charity and giving into the entire new year? Here are three ways to do it:

**1.** **Pick a theme each month.**

There is a “national month” for just about every cause under the sun. Take the opportunity to sit down with your family or friends at the beginning of each month and explore that month’s “themes” until you find one to which you feel connected. Then find a charity or organization that works in that area and that you’d like to support. Revisit again the following month and pick new causes and charities.

To get you started, January is: [National Blood Donor Month](http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Resolve-to-Give-during-National-Blood-Donor-Month), J[anuary 11th is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Day](http://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/national-human-trafficking-awareness-day-january-11/), [Poverty Awareness Month](http://www.usccb.org/about/catholic-campaign-for-human-development/poverty-education/poverty-awareness-month.cfm), [National Glaucoma Awareness Month](http://www.glaucoma.org/news/glaucoma-awareness-month.php), [National Cervical Health Awareness Month](http://www.nccc-online.org/hpvcervical-cancer/cervical-health-awareness-month/), to name just a few.

**2.** **Schedule and forget.**

Have a charity that you are committed to and that you support regularly? Just like you can schedule automatic bill payments, set up an “automatic donation payment” that gets deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit card every month or every quarter. Some charities and organizations let you do this through their website; for others, you may need to call to set it up. Either way, once all the details are in place, it’s completely hassle free, and you’re all set.

**3.** **Sign up to be a Giver or Quiver on Quiv.com.**.

[Quiv](http://www.quiv.com) is a new platform that allows individuals to convert their time, experience and knowledge into charitable donations for their favorite causes, by providing great advice for others. [Register as a Giver](https://quiv.com/users/sign_up?promo=blog&aff=Giving010117) to let Quivers (question givers — get it?) pick your brain while raising money for the cause of your choice. Or sign up as a Quiver to connect with Givers and get great advice in exchange for a charitable donation. Either way, you’re on your way to making the world a better place. I was looking for ways to facilitate donations and I thought this concept would allow both sides to gain while feeling good, so I gathered a team and developed it.

Happy New Year! Here’s to making 2017 one full of giving and meaning.
