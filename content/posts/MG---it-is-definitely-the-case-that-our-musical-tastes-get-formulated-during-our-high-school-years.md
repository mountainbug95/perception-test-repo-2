MG — it is definitely the case that our musical tastes get formulated during our high school years. When I was running AOL Music Now (a decade ago…) we wanted to provide the user with a great FTUE and the only thing we knew was the user’s DOB we would put together a playlist based on the hits of their high school era. The users were amazed at how the service would know to all the music they loved :-)
