<span class="lead-letter">W</span>e knew things were spiraling out of control when I had to create a spreadsheet to keep track of all the packages arriving at my doorstep.

I’d fallen prey to a few online sales over the holidays. I’ve usually been able to keep my mindless consumerism in check, so I wasn’t worried by each new urge to hit “buy” — I just did it. And then, a few weeks later, I found myself tallying up hundreds of dollars in purchases and fighting off a mounting sense of shame. The kicker? Most of those purchases are still sitting unused in my closet.

At its most extreme, an online shopping habit can take the form of compulsive buying disorder, or CBD — a behavioral addiction, like gambling or overeating, that affects an estimated 5.8 percent of Americans, according to a 2007 study. People with CBD (also known as oniomania, an obsessive or uncontrollable urge to buy things) report having a preoccupation with shopping, pre-purchase tension or anxiety, and a sense of relief following the purchase. But even for those who haven’t reached the level of pathology, the lure of online shopping can be hard to resist, especially because it’s so easy: Set your credit card info to auto-populate, and you don’t even have to get up from the couch.

It’s an expensive habit, but not an unbreakable one. Below, financial therapists and money experts offer their advice on how to reel in your online spending and regain control of your finances.

## Reacquaint yourself with what you already have.

<span class="highlight">Chances are you have a closet of clothes you’ve barely worn, and probably lots of items that look like each other. Take the time to clear out your wardrobe and look around your home for items you don’t need. Also, return anything that still has the tags.</span>

n my effort to be more minimalist, I have adopted a “one in, one out” rule. This helps you become more aware of what you have and what you need, and when you’re just accumulating stuff. Think about this before buying something new and be prepared to donate or gift the item you’re replacing.

The Back Door — There are garbage shoots in many buildings. Can we repurpose them as package elevators. There is also probably some room behind the walls. Can we build new ones? Maybe even smart ones that take packages one way and garbage another direction but are still sanitary? Can we create closets and refrigerators with back doors into the guts of the building? Could your laundry and amazon order go straight up a retrofitted garbage shoot straight into your fridge through a trapdoor in the wall and a backdoor into your refrigerator? I wonder what this would do to customer expectations? Raining outside? let me order an umbrella from the basement mini-robotic supermarket! I am sure you can think of other last minute items you may want to order to the fridge or bedroom.

So where do you find these mythical VC firms? Most of them are based in the biggest tech hubs in the nation, and it’s rare to find a VC firm in one geographic region of the country investing in a startup company located in another part of the country. Thus, it’s no surprise that California (home to sunny weather and even sunnier Silicon Valley startups) accounts for 50–60 percent of all VC deal volume in any given year, while New York City and Massachusetts (home to all the whiz kid startups in Boston and Cambridge) account for another 20–25 percent of all VC deal volume.That leaves a sliver of VC deal volume in places like Texas, Illinois, Washington State, and Colorado. So here’s the reality — unless you’re based in a huge tech hub, the chances of lining up a big chunk of seed or Series A funding are going to be extremely low.
