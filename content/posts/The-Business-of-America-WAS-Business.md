Beware, incoming rant…

About 100 years ago, President Calvin Coolidge said **“The Business of America is Business”.**

(Actually, he said “the chief business of the American people is business”, but the above sounds better)

It used to be that a major chunk of the US economy was made of small businesses. Over the past few decades, more and more of these small businesses start out as small tech companies (aka Startups)

However, as things become easier and simpler on the tech front, and you can launch a tech startup with very little funds, resources, etc. (in fact, you probably only need a cheap laptop and a few hundred dollars to be able to launch a startup), it seems to me that things are becoming much more difficult on the administrative/bureaucratic/government regulated aspects.

Yesterday, I attempted to open a bank account….

The key word being “attempted”. What followed was a ridiculous sequence of events.

So, I went to my Citibank branch, and requested to open a “Business” account. The kind clerk took my ID, and all the necessary paperwork and proceeded to follow a “script”.

“What kind of a business is it? he asked.

“An Internet business” I said. Boy, was that a mistake.

“May I see the website?” He asked.

“We don’t have a website yet. It is in the process of being built and will not be up until it is launched”, I said.

At this point, all engines came to a shrieking stop. He did not know how to proceed.

“Surely, this is not out of the ordinary”, I said. “Many startup do not make their website public before they have actually built it”

He asked the branch manager, but she was of no help. “If we do not follow the process, we will be fired. Have you heard what happened to Wells Fargo?” I had no clue what happened to Wells Fargo, and why it would impact my situation.

To be clear, I am well familiar with the need for a KYC (Know Your Customer), but as things go, I have been a customer at this specific Citibank branch for over 20 years, have multiple personal and business accounts there and not an insignificant amount of money…

“I have an idea”, I said. “We have a landing page on our site saying that we are coming soon and asking interested users to enter their email address, to be informed when we go live”.

“Great, that would work. Let’s bring it up on my screen” said the clerk.

As soon as he entered the URL, his citibank screen responded with a response in huge red letters:

### WARNING!!! PHISHING SITE!!!

This is a simple web page with a logo, some text explaining the service and a box for users to enter their email address.

Why has citibank decided to classify this is a phishing site? Who can we talk to about this? No Answer.

“OK” I said. “I opened an account here a few months ago for a holding company, and had no problems. let’s call this a holding company too”.

“No, too late, I already know that this is an Internet company”, he said.

So, no bank account had been opened.
