On friday, a new president will be settling into place in the White House — whether you are happy about it or not.

At this point, all we have is speculation regarding what will actually happen once President-elect Trump becomes President Trump (and even then it may take a while for him to make good on campaign promises, if at all). Still, whatever does happen, the impact of the new presidency will be felt not only domestically, but also globally.

Giving, too, is sure to be affected.

**What Does Political Transition Mean to Giving?**

#### **Causes**

Many Democrat and other non-Trump supporters have viewed the results of the election as an opportunity — a call, even — to support liberal-leaning organizations that may feel under attack by the Trump presidency. For example, [Planned Parenthood](https://quiv.com/charity_funds/planned-parenthood-federation-of), the [ACLU](https://quiv.com/charity_funds/american-civil-liberties-union-inc), environment-related charities, and many organizations representing individuals with disabilities, immigrants, Muslims, and the [LGBTQ community,](https://quiv.com/charity_funds/glaad-inc) among others, have ramped up fundraising efforts in response to Trump’s campaign rhetoric and fear that they might lose funding and support under the new administration.

On the other hand, more conservative leaning organizations, may be concerned that their supporters would think that there is less need for donations, now that two (and possibly all three) branches of government are run by the Republican party. Or anticipating less government funding for various causes, would people open up their pockets and be more charitable? Will charities like [Catholic Charities USA](https://quiv.com/charity_funds/catholic-charities-usa), [Lutheran Services in America](https://quiv.com/charity_funds/lutheran-services-in-america-incorporated), or [Feeding America](https://quiv.com/charity_funds/feeding-america), see more, or less donations?

#### **Taxes**

Even if one of the abovementioned organizations or causes isn’t on your radar or you’re not worried about your specific charity, taxes could change the picture. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to slash taxes, and many nonprofits are worried that this could negatively affect charitable giving. Actually, even before Trump’s victory, Urban Institute and Brookings Institution’s Tax Policy Center published a report on how both Trump and Hillary Clinton [would reduce tax incentives for charitable giving](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/both-clinton-and-trump-would-reduce-tax-incentives-charitable-giving). In Trump’s case, the report cited that he would: reduce marginal tax rates, which would increase the after-tax cost to individuals donating to charity; raise the standard deduction, reducing the number of people itemizing, including of charitable giving; and cap itemized deductions, which would do away with the incentive of giving for high-income taxpayers. Indeed, the end of 2016 saw a surge of charitable giving, with individuals in the top bracket (39.6 percent, which is poised to be lowered to 33 percent under Trump) rushing to take advantage of the increased federal tax savings before its potential reduction this year.

With the Trump administration in place, the concern is that over time, especially, the financial benefits, lessening its value to many people. Still, some analysts remain optimistic that with the proposed tax cuts and corresponding savings, individuals will have more available funds to give.

**What can you do?**

During this period of transition, speak to your preferred nonprofits and charitable organizations to see what their concerns are, how they expect to be affected, and how you can be supportive. And remember that no matter who is in power, most challenges we face as a society — hunger, poverty, education, healthcare, and medical research, to name just a few — aren’t going away and s[till need our donations and support.](http://www.quiv.com/?aff=blog4)
