Last week I had the opportunity to spend some time in Guatemala. I have never been there before and prior to my visit, the only preconceived notion I had of the place was Woody Allen’s 1971 movie “[Bananas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqsda-1h_y8)”.

Guatemala’s main exports are bananas, coffee and sugar, so my initial assumptions were not completely baseless.

The first thing that quickly became apparent to me was the fact that people were extremely nice, simply nice. Everyone I have met — from servants to service providers, from entrepreneurs to country presidents, from paupers to princes — were all very nice people. Everywhere I went, I was greeted with smiles (real smiles, not the phony type), and sincere wishes to help.

The other element that surprised me was the enterprising spirit of the local entrepreneurs. Granted, I was part of an unconference that usually attracts such individuals, but nevertheless it surprised me. Perhaps it is part of my white man, built-in western prejudices.

Lastly, I was surprised by the type of high tech companies I saw. Offices filled with hundreds of software developers, using the latest stacks, utilizing the same platforms and methodologies you would see in any tech company in San Francisco, New York, or Tel Aviv.

With a modern infrastructure, high caliber entrepreneurs, and the leadership of successful serial entrepreneurs like [Matias de Tezanos](https://twitter.com/TwoCentz) all within a few hours flight of many US cities, it would seem that the country has the potential to become a global tech center.

Yet, this is still not a foregone conclusion. Many challenges are still to be resolved, not the least of which is crime. Being mugged under gun point is a daily occurrence, and one does not walk down the street without armed guards (most people simply drive from point to point and do not walk anywhere). The people I have met are very aware of this challenge and are looking for creative ways to solve it.

I enjoyed Guatemala and my experience with its people, and hope to have a chance to visit again.
