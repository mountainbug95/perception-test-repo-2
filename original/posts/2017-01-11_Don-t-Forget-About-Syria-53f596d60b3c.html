The usual pre-Christmas and Hanukkah posts died down for a while, as did talk about the U.S. elections.</p><p name="83de" id="83de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But just as quickly as it all rose to the surface, it went away again. How many of your feeds went back to seemingly disembodied hands preparing one-bowl desserts and sheet-pan dinners, dogs playing in the snow, and articles about Russia? Mine certainly did.</p><p name="3235" id="3235" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Syria, however, is still a crisis.</strong></p><p name="39e6" id="39e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Its people — both those who managed to flee and those who were unable to — are living a round-the-clock nightmare. For those of us who just finished celebrating a season filled with light, gifts, family, and abundance, the magnitude of the loss and destruction is simply incomprehensible.</p><p name="4efb" id="4efb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It’s not too late to help.</strong></p><p name="7eff" id="7eff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sign up as a Giver on <a href="http://www.quiv.com" data-href="http://www.quiv.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Quiv</a> (it’s free!), and select one of these organizations, which have been working on the ground, around the clock to help the people of Syria as well as refugees, as your preferred cause:</p><p name="7df7" id="7df7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/doctors-without-borders-usa-inc" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/doctors-without-borders-usa-inc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Doctors Without Borders / Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)</strong></a></p><p name="e883" id="e883" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When it comes to crises around the world, MSF is often one of the first organizations to be found on the ground. Despite significant regime-imposed constraints, regular bombings of its hospitals, and targeting of its doctors, MSF continues to distribute hygiene kits, clothing, blankets, and medications as well as supporting medical facilities and mobile clinics.</p><p name="701c" id="701c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/save-the-children-federation-inc" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/save-the-children-federation-inc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Save the Children</strong></a></p><p name="658f" id="658f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With some 12,000 children displaced throughout Syria and out of school, Save the Children is carrying out efforts to distribute food, blankets, and emergency supplies, as well as offer educational programs in temporary spaces. The organization has also organized emergency healthcare services.</p><p name="e009" id="e009" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/globalgiving-foundation-inc" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/globalgiving-foundation-inc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">GlobalGiving</strong></a></p><p name="4a90" id="4a90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through its Syria Refugee Relief Fund, GlobalGiving supports over a dozen vetted, on-the-ground organizations working to provide refugees who have been displaced within Syria and to neighboring countries with relief and assistance. The organization has distributed food, water, and hygiene kits, and enabled safe access to medical care and psychosocial support.</p><p name="605b" id="605b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/mercy-corps" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/mercy-corps" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">MercyCorps</strong></a></p><p name="108d" id="108d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mercy Corps remains committed to helping all Syrians in need — as theu have been for years. Everyone deserves to have clean water, food and medical care, no matter where they live or what forces control their town.</p><p name="85ac" id="85ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For years, Mercy Corps’ team in Syria has courageously navigated battlefields to help alleviate the intense suffering of people trapped in the crossfire of this deadly conflict.</p><p name="82e9" id="82e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Right now, they have teams in northern Syria providing food, blankets and other supplies for evacuees from Aleppo and other newly displaced Syrians</p><p name="87b7" id="87b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When it comes to Syria, this list barely scratches the surface. Quiv’s database lists over one million nonprofits or charitable organizations recognized by local regulators, including many others that support Syrian civilians and refugees.</p><p name="da92" id="da92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Do you have a preferred Syria-related organization?
