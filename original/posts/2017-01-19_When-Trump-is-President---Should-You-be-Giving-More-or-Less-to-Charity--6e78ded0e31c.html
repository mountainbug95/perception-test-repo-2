Still, whatever does happen, the impact of the new presidency will be felt not only domestically, but also globally.</p><p name="00f4" id="00f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Giving, too, is sure to be affected.</p></div></div></section><section name="cc6e" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a768" id="a768" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What Does Political Transition Mean to Giving?</strong></p><h4 name="b16c" id="b16c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Causes</strong></h4><p name="9622" id="9622" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Many Democrat and other non-Trump supporters have viewed the results of the election as an opportunity — a call, even — to support liberal-leaning organizations that may feel under attack by the Trump presidency. For example, <a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/planned-parenthood-federation-of" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/planned-parenthood-federation-of" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Planned Parenthood</a>, the <a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/american-civil-liberties-union-inc" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/american-civil-liberties-union-inc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ACLU</a>, environment-related charities, and many organizations representing individuals with disabilities, immigrants, Muslims, and the <a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/glaad-inc" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/glaad-inc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LGBTQ community,</a> among others, have ramped up fundraising efforts in response to Trump’s campaign rhetoric and fear that they might lose funding and support under the new administration.</p><p name="4536" id="4536" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, more conservative leaning organizations, may be concerned that their supporters would think that there is less need for donations, now that two (and possibly all three) branches of government are run by the Republican party. Or anticipating less government funding for various causes, would people open up their pockets and be more charitable? Will charities like <a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/catholic-charities-usa" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/catholic-charities-usa" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Catholic Charities USA</a>, <a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/lutheran-services-in-america-incorporated" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/lutheran-services-in-america-incorporated" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lutheran Services in America</a>, or <a href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/feeding-america" data-href="https://quiv.com/charity_funds/feeding-america" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Feeding America</a>, see more, or less donations?</p><h4 name="06b0" id="06b0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Taxes</strong></h4><p name="638c" id="638c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Even if one of the abovementioned organizations or causes isn’t on your radar or you’re not worried about your specific charity, taxes could change the picture. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to slash taxes, and many nonprofits are worried that this could negatively affect charitable giving. Actually, even before Trump’s victory, Urban Institute and Brookings Institution’s Tax Policy Center published a report on how both Trump and Hillary Clinton <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/both-clinton-and-trump-would-reduce-tax-incentives-charitable-giving" data-href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/both-clinton-and-trump-would-reduce-tax-incentives-charitable-giving" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would reduce tax incentives for charitable giving</a>. In Trump’s case, the report cited that he would: reduce marginal tax rates, which would increase the after-tax cost to individuals donating to charity; raise the standard deduction, reducing the number of people itemizing, including of charitable giving; and cap itemized deductions, which would do away with the incentive of giving for high-income taxpayers. Indeed, the end of 2016 saw a surge of charitable giving, with individuals in the top bracket (39.6 percent, which is poised to be lowered to 33 percent under Trump) rushing to take advantage of the increased federal tax savings before its potential reduction this year.</p><p name="db15" id="db15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the Trump administration in place, the concern is that over time, especially, the financial benefits, lessening its value to many people. Still, some analysts remain optimistic that with the proposed tax cuts and corresponding savings, individuals will have more available funds to give.</p><p name="e1db" id="e1db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What can you do?</strong></p><p name="eec1" id="eec1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">During this period of transition, speak to your preferred nonprofits and charitable organizations to see what their concerns are, how they expect to be affected, and how you can be supportive. And remember that no matter who is in power, most challenges we face as a society — hunger, poverty, education, healthcare, and medical research, to name just a few — aren’t going away and s<a href="http://www.quiv.com/?aff=blog4" data-href="http://www.quiv.com/?aff=blog4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">till need our donations and support.</a></p></div></div></section>
