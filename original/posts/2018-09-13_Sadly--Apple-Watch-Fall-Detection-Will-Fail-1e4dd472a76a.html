Falls threaten seniors’ safety and independence and generate enormous economic and personal costs.</p><p name="0a30" id="0a30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or rather it is not the fall itself that is the problem, but rather, lying on the floor for extended periods of time (hours or days), alone and undetected until help arrives, is the cause for many health and mental problems that are often so severe that the Senior never fully recuperates.</p><p name="4909" id="4909" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem of falls has been addressed by many companies for over 40 years. Who has not heard the ad “Help, I have fallen and can’t get up”?</p><p name="1f99" id="1f99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the years, many have tried to provide solutions. From large companies like <a href="http://www.securitysystemsnews.com/article/ge-jumps-back-pers-0" data-href="http://www.securitysystemsnews.com/article/ge-jumps-back-pers-0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE</a>, Intel, <a href="https://www.lifeline.philips.com/" data-href="https://www.lifeline.philips.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phillips</a>, <a href="http://about.att.com/newsroom/portable_peace_of_mind_with_the_new_everthere_device_dec.html" data-href="http://about.att.com/newsroom/portable_peace_of_mind_with_the_new_everthere_device_dec.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AT&amp;T</a> to many smaller startups like MyLively, Great Calls and many more.</p><p name="ba26" id="ba26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet after so many years and after so many attempts — less than 5% of US seniors (over 50 million) have any type of fall detection solution.</p><p name="ebb6" id="ebb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, of those seniors who DO have a PERS (Personal Emergency Response System) — only 15% actually use it after a fall (the device is not on them, the fall is not auto-detected, the senior does not press the button, etc.)</p><p name="03c8" id="03c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Enter Apple Watch fall detection. For the purpose of this post, I will assume that the algorithm works almost perfectly and that it detects 100% of falls.</p><p name="da06" id="da06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is why it will still fail:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="9cbf" id="9cbf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Not wearing it.</strong><br>Most falls that are of consequence happen in the home. Very often in the shower or while getting out of bed. At that time the senior is not wearing the watch (probably being charged next to the bed, or out taken off before shower/bath)</li><li name="4544" id="4544" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Charging.</strong><br>The watch requires daily charging. That is a task that is still quite challenging for many seniors.</li><li name="8ee1" id="8ee1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Calling 911 with False-Positives.</strong><br>Inevitably, there will be instances where the watch detects a fall when there wasn’t one. Given that in many (most?) cases it will not have been programmed to contact relatives (son, daughter, neighbor) — it will contact emergency services (i.e. 911) . After a couple of times where the emergency staff show up for no reason — they will start to charge the senior for the unwarranted “visit”, thus adding another reason for the senior to not wear the watch.</li><li name="6a20" id="6a20" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Price</strong>.<br>In all the researches that were done over the past few years, price (or perception of price) was quoted as being the main reason why the senior did not have a PERS solution. And we are talking about solutions that are much less expensive than the Apple Watch. For those who are less sensitive to price — there are many some solutions available today, and yet they too are not adopted en-masse. An Apple Watch with a starting price of $499, will most likely simply not be affordable for most seniors.</li></ol><p name="9418" id="9418" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">I love Apple products. I have the latest Mac, the latest iPad, the latest iPhone (soon) and the latest Apple Watch. Sadly, in my opinion, the Apple Watch will have negligible to no impact on this issue given its two main challenges (complex daily recharge and cost).</p><p name="a3e9" id="a3e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only technology that can have an actual impact is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">low-cost</strong> “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">passive</strong>” (not requiring the senior&#39;s involvement/participation) monitoring solution.</p><p name="9381" id="9381" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sadly, this solution does not yet exist, and given its strategy (high cost, high margins) I doubt it would ever come out of Apple.</p><p name="0ea6" id="0ea6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some stats about senior falls from the CDC:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="c0dc" id="c0dc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">One in four Americans aged 65+ falls each year.</li><li name="cc9e" id="cc9e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Every 11 seconds, an older adult is treated in the emergency room for a fall; every 19 minutes, an older adult dies from a fall.</li><li name="1e22" id="1e22" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Falls are the leading cause of fatal injury and the most common cause of nonfatal trauma-related hospital admissions among older adults.</li><li name="f1d7" id="f1d7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Falls result in more than 2.8 million injuries treated in emergency departments annually, including over 800,000 hospitalizations and more than 27,000 deaths.</li><li name="65a1" id="65a1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">In 2015, the total cost of fall injuries was $50 billion. Medicare and Medicaid shouldered 75% of these costs.</li><li name="29e3" id="29e3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The financial toll for older adult falls is expected to increase as the population ages and may reach $67.7 billion by 2020.</li></ul><p name="4e28" id="4e28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Falls, with or without injury, also carry a heavy quality of life impact. A growing number of older adults fear falling and, as a result, limit their activities and social engagements. This can result in further physical decline, depression, social isolation, and feelings of helplessness.</p><p name="6e8c" id="6e8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Some sources:<br><a href="https://www.ageinplacetech.com/files/aip/Linkage%202016%20Technology%20April%202016.pdf" data-href="https://www.ageinplacetech.com/files/aip/Linkage%202016%20Technology%20April%202016.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2016 Technology Survey Older Adults, Age 59–85+</a><br><a href="http://www.geritech.org/2015/12/personal-emergency-response-systems.html/" data-href="http://www.geritech.org/2015/12/personal-emergency-response-systems.html/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Personal Emergency Response Systems</a><br><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2590903/" data-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2590903/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Inability to get up after falling, subsequent time on floor, and summoning help: a prospective cohort study in people over 90</a><br><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20814795" data-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20814795" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Satisfaction and use of personal emergency response systems.</a><br><a href="https://www.freeus.com/pers-market-insights/" data-href="https://www.freeus.com/pers-market-insights/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PERS market insights and your business</a><br><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/385066/top-pers-companies-in-north-america-by-customers/" data-href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/385066/top-pers-companies-in-north-america-by-customers/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Top companies in the North American PERS industry based on the estimated number of customers in 2014*</a></p></div></div></section>
