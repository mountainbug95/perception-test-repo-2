If that’s the case, then the point of view in my post stands, and it will indeed fail.</p><p name="3187" id="3187" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, to understand what Facebook’s ultimate goal is, one needs to go back to its mission statement as presented by Mark Zuckerberg –</p><p name="47a5" id="47a5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”</p><p name="7c2a" id="7c2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this context, it stands to reason that Facebook Dating’s real mission is to help people create meaningful relationships, which means they are not going after the more casual market.</p><p name="1769" id="1769" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given this context, I will attempt to analyze Facebook Dating’s promise under the same three criteria as in my previous post</p><p name="85dc" id="85dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Single App Policy</strong></p><p name="8002" id="8002" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/" data-href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">~2.2 Billion users (MAUs)</a> of which ~90% are mobile of which ~90% use the Facebook app. That is a huge number of users. According to Facebook, <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/5/1/17307816/facebook-dating-app-opt-in-single-status-f8" data-href="https://www.recode.net/2018/5/1/17307816/facebook-dating-app-opt-in-single-status-f8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 200 Million users claim to be single</a>. There are many millions of users who do not list relationship status at all, but it can be inferred that some of those are single as well. Given these stats I can definitely conclude that the existing Facebook app is already the world’s largest dating app. There is no need to create a new app. Users use it to connect with others every day. The challenge is that it does not necessarily create great matches. More about that later.</p><p name="6245" id="6245" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Creating a new app adds another layer of friction. Facebook already has what every other app developer would kill for: it’s already installed on virtually everyone’s phone. Users already HAVE the Facebook app. Users are already USING the Facebook app. Why spend the resources developing a new app when the right users for this application are already there?</p><p name="a1fd" id="a1fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Monetization</strong></p><p name="4f4c" id="4f4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook’s great advantage is its business model. They brought the media/ad model to a level of art. Facebook knows how to monetize a media service better than any other service out there. It has the platform, the personnel, the resources, the proven experience and the know-how. Why change that?</p><p name="e9e4" id="e9e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Very few companies have assets of this caliber at their disposal. That is one of Facebook’s main competitive advantages. It would be foolish to abandon it for the unwarranted adventure of learning a totally new freemium business model.</p><p name="ae88" id="ae88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would also add that placing a pay wall would quite literally be contrary to Facebook’s mission, as it would prevent people with lesser means to participate and connect.</p><p name="f4d8" id="f4d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook makes money by connecting business to people — NOT by connecting people to each other.</p><p name="be5c" id="be5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Thinking Small</strong></p><p name="53da" id="53da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my previous post, I argued that if Facebook were to go down the casual dating rabbit hole, it would be thinking small and would not be maximizing the potential business opportunity at its finger tips.</p><p name="c3b8" id="c3b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would contend that maximizing revenues is not necessarily Facebook’s main objective. Rather, Facebook generates revenues as a result of executing well on its mission of connecting people and bringing the world closer.</p><p name="2599" id="2599" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe that Facebook Dating has a grander, loftier, and way more difficult goal than to simply generate additional revenues.</p><p name="70cf" id="70cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few months ago, I wrote a post titled <a href="https://medium.com/@ashafrir/facebooks-next-big-thing-b701d9d99a6e" data-href="https://medium.com/@ashafrir/facebooks-next-big-thing-b701d9d99a6e" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Facebook’s Next Big Thing</a>, articulating that Facebook should find a way to connect people who SHOULD know each other.</p><p name="825c" id="825c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think this is EXACTLY what Facebook’s wants to solve, and this not only isn’t “thinking small,” but it is virtually reaching for the stars.</p><p name="9d73" id="9d73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a world where modern AI algorithms have been taught to identify cats and flowers in pictures, and to read x-rays and diagnose illnesses, is that too far-fetched to believe that it will be possible for them to match compatible people? This sounds a bit like science fiction, but just last week, <a href="https://hinge.co/" data-href="https://hinge.co/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hinge</a> (a dating service owned by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;tbm=fin&amp;q=NASDAQ:+MTCH" data-href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;tbm=fin&amp;q=NASDAQ:+MTCH" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Match Group: MTCH</a>) has announced a service called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/hinge-employs-new-algorithm-to-find-your-most-compatible-match-for-you/" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/hinge-employs-new-algorithm-to-find-your-most-compatible-match-for-you/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Most Compatible</em></a> that uses machine learning to figure out each user’s taste, relying on the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/kleinberg-tardos/pdf/01StableMatching.pdf" data-href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/kleinberg-tardos/pdf/01StableMatching.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gale-Shapley algorithm</a> to determine every user’s perfect match.</p><p name="e414" id="e414" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, this is quite a rudimentary and simple algorithm, and it relies on limited data that the Hinge service has accumulated, but imagine an algorithm that uses the vast troves of data that Facebook has. Facebook knows us better than we know ourselves and can find matches that would be compatible with us by also analyzing the billions of connections between people. In my <a href="https://medium.com/@ashafrir/facebooks-next-big-thing-b701d9d99a6e" data-href="https://medium.com/@ashafrir/facebooks-next-big-thing-b701d9d99a6e" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Facebook’s Next Big Thing</a> post I elaborated a little bit more on this point.</p><p name="8877" id="8877" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook could turn out to be a better matchmaker than Fiddler on the Roof’s <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0ShvQ2fhKM?t=32s" data-href="https://youtu.be/Y0ShvQ2fhKM?t=32s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yente</a>.</p><p name="2286" id="2286" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And so, the 26% drop in MATCH’s share price on the day of Facebook’s announcement may very well have been warranted. Not because of its impact on Tinder, but rather on its flagship Match.com service, which may soon become obsolete.</p></div></div></section>
