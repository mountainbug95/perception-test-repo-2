Over the past few decades, more and more of these small businesses start out as small tech companies (aka Startups)</p><p name="14df" id="14df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, as things become easier and simpler on the tech front, and you can launch a tech startup with very little funds, resources, etc. (in fact, you probably only need a cheap laptop and a few hundred dollars to be able to launch a startup), it seems to me that things are becoming much more difficult on the administrative/bureaucratic/government regulated aspects.</p><p name="858f" id="858f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yesterday, I attempted to open a bank account….</p><p name="6fda" id="6fda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The key word being “attempted”. What followed was a ridiculous sequence of events.</p><p name="acce" id="acce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, I went to my Citibank branch, and requested to open a “Business” account. The kind clerk took my ID, and all the necessary paperwork and proceeded to follow a “script”.</p><p name="c68b" id="c68b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What kind of a business is it? he asked.</p><p name="2b4b" id="2b4b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“An Internet business” I said. Boy, was that a mistake.</p><p name="0ade" id="0ade" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“May I see the website?” He asked.</p><p name="b759" id="b759" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We don’t have a website yet. It is in the process of being built and will not be up until it is launched”, I said.</p><p name="5cf7" id="5cf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point, all engines came to a shrieking stop. He did not know how to proceed.</p><p name="ec16" id="ec16" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Surely, this is not out of the ordinary”, I said. “Many startup do not make their website public before they have actually built it”</p><p name="c5c8" id="c5c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He asked the branch manager, but she was of no help. “If we do not follow the process, we will be fired. Have you heard what happened to Wells Fargo?” I had no clue what happened to Wells Fargo, and why it would impact my situation.</p><p name="dcb9" id="dcb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be clear, I am well familiar with the need for a KYC (Know Your Customer), but as things go, I have been a customer at this specific Citibank branch for over 20 years, have multiple personal and business accounts there and not an insignificant amount of money…</p><p name="4480" id="4480" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I have an idea”, I said. “We have a landing page on our site saying that we are coming soon and asking interested users to enter their email address, to be informed when we go live”.</p><p name="4fd2" id="4fd2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Great, that would work. Let’s bring it up on my screen” said the clerk.</p><p name="13c5" id="13c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As soon as he entered the URL, his citibank screen responded with a response in huge red letters:</p><h3 name="e09b" id="e09b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">WARNING!!! PHISHING SITE!!!</h3><p name="3fea" id="3fea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is a simple web page with a logo, some text explaining the service and a box for users to enter their email address.</p><p name="1d48" id="1d48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why has citibank decided to classify this is a phishing site? Who can we talk to about this? No Answer.</p><p name="8157" id="8157" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“OK” I said. “I opened an account here a few months ago for a holding company, and had no problems. let’s call this a holding company too”.</p><p name="2661" id="2661" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“No, too late, I already know that this is an Internet company”, he said.</p><p name="f508" id="f508" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, no bank account had been opened.</p><p name="2319" id="2319" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">:-(</p></div></div></section>
