Where did the idea come from?</p><p name="c864" id="c864" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For years, I’ve struggled with a challenge: There are so many smart, knowledgeable people with whom I’d love to connect. How can I meet or chat with them to pick their brains and learn from their experience?</p><p name="902b" id="902b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m pretty well connected, and if I put some effort into it, I’m usually able to get an introduction.</p><p name="3148" id="3148" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But after that there was no guarantee that the person would respond or put any real effort into answering my questions. At best, they might talk to me (sometimes even begrudgingly) as a favor to the person who introduced us; at worst, I’d be left hanging.</p><p name="9d5b" id="9d5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem, as I saw it, was that there was no compelling reason for the other party to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">want</em> to answer my questions, to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">want</em> to meet or talk or share their experience.</p><p name="d63c" id="d63c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know what you’re thinking: Money. I could just <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pay</em> them for their time.</p><p name="e209" id="e209" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But a lot of these people either didn’t need or want the money, and might even feel insulted by such an offer.</p><p name="906c" id="906c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, no, that wasn’t the answer. Back to the drawing board.</p><p name="ece6" id="ece6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do I get a complete stranger to genuinely <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">want</em> to let me pick their brain?</p><p name="6896" id="6896" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then, over dinner with a friend (fine wine was involved), discussing this challenge, the answer hit us.</p><p name="143b" id="143b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Altruism. Giving!</strong> That’s the key to a person’s heart.</p><p name="c45d" id="c45d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most people have causes that they’re passionate about, and whether privately or publically, they’re willing to spend time, effort and cold, hard cash on them.</p><p name="3895" id="3895" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My friend and I spent hours that evening figuring out how to bridge these two different agendas: one person needs advice; the other wants to support a charitable cause.</p><p name="5df7" id="5df7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that’s how Quiv was born.</p><p name="a96c" id="a96c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Quiv was created with the goal of enabling folks to connect with experts and pick their brains — and of giving those experts a good reason to let their brains be picked.</p><p name="dc69" id="dc69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today we’re excited to launch our closed, invitation-only alpha version of Quiv to give Givers (experts and people with great experience) the opportunity to register and carve out the niche areas in which they feel comfortable giving advice.</p><p name="b9a8" id="b9a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Down the road, our plan for Quiv is to create a plaform that allows said Givers to convert their time, experience and knowledge into real money for the causes they support by giving great advice that helps Quivers (the people asking the questions and looking for answers).</p><p name="ada3" id="ada3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the infinite number of questions to be asked and causes to help in the world, we’re excited and confident about the ability of Givers and Quivers to help each other and make a real impact on the world.</p><p name="a140" id="a140" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Why Quiv? Because <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">asking is the new giving!</em></p></div></div></section>
